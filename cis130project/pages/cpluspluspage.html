                <p id="javadescription"><strong>C++ is general-purpose object-oriented programming language, and shares many characteristics with Java.
                        C++ was originally developed by Bjarne Stroustrup.</strong></p>
                <p>C++ was originally called “C with classes”, as it was an extension of the already existing C programming language. But, the C++
                    language incorporated the use of classes, thus making C++ object oriented. The language was renamed C++ in 1983.</p>
                <p>C++ is considered an intermediate-level language. This is because C++ includes a mixture of both high and low-level language features.</p>
                <p>C++ is extremely popular and is one of the predominant languages for the development of technical and commercial software.</p>

                <h2>What is C++?</h2>
                <p>C++ is a cross-platform language, and because of its speed, can be used to create high-performance applications. 
                    C++ allows self-memory management, which in turn enhances the execution speed of a program.</p>
                <p><strong>C++ is :</strong></p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>An <strong>object-oriented</strong> programming language. Meaning the programs are given clear structure which allows code to be reused. This
                        lowers development costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Portable,</strong> meaning C++ can be used to develop applications that can eventually be adapted to <strong>multiple platforms.</strong></li>
                    <li>Because of its close similarities to C# and Java, it is easy for programmers to make the switch to C++ if they have experience in those langauges.</li>
                    <li>Fun and easy to learn!</li>
                </ul>
            </aside>

            <aside>
                <h2>What's C++ Used For?</h2>

                <p>Almost all high-level machine language libraries use C++ for their backend. C++ is faster than most of the other programming languages, because of the self-memory management.
                    C++ also supports multithreading with concurrency. Thus, applications that require speed and concurrency, would likely use the C++ language for development.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Games:</strong> Because C++ is so close to the hardware, it can easily manipulate resources, while providing procedural programming over CPU intensive functions. And 
                        because it is C++, it is fast. It also has the ability to override the complexities of 3D games while providing multilayer networking.</li>
                    <li><strong>GUI Based Applications:</strong> GUI based apps as well as desktop apps can easily be written using C++.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Software:</strong> C++ can also be used to write database management software. MySQL and Postgres, are among the two most popular databases, and are written in C++.</li>
                    <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> C++ is strongly typed and fast, thus is a perfect candidate for writing operating systems. C++ provides
                        system-level functions that help with writing low-level programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Browsers:</strong> For the most part, browsers are used in C++ for rendering purposes. Rendering engines need to be fast, so people
                        aren't waiting long for a web page to display. Because C++ has such quick performance, most browsers have rendering software written in C++.</li>
                </ul>
