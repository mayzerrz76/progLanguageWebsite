                <h1 class="languageheader">Python Language</h1>
                <p id="javadescription"><strong>Python is attractive for a first language because it offers simple, easy to learn syntax. It also emphasizes readability
                        and therefore reduces costs for maintaining programs written with Python.
                        Python also supports modules and packages. This promotes modularity across programs as well as code reuse.</strong></p>
                <p>Python language was first created in the late 1980s, and it was first released in 1991. Guido van Rossum developed the language as a successor to the ABC programming language. </p>
                <p>Python can be described as an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language, that includes dynamic semantics. Python includes built-in
                    data structures, along with dynamic typing and binding.  These features make Python attractive for Rapid Application Decelopment.
                    It can also be used as a "glue language", meaning it can be used to connect existing components together.</p>
                <p>Python offers increased productivity because of its easy to learn/read syntax, making it very appealing to programmers. Also, given that there is no compilation step, 
                    the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast with Python. </p>

                <h2>What is Python?</h2>
                <p>Again, Python is an interpreted, high-level and general-purpose programming language. Python emphasizes code readability, using a significant
                    amount of whitespace in the source code. Python's language constructs and approach to object-oriented programming help programmers write clear and logical code 
                    for small or large-scale projects.</p>
                <p><strong>Python is :</strong></p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>A language that supports multiple programming <strong>paradigms.</strong> This includes structured(procedural), <strong>object-oriented</strong>, and functional programming.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamically typed</strong> and <strong>garbage-collected</strong>, similar to Java garbage collection.</li>
                    <li>Described sometimes as a "batteries included" language. This is due to its comprehensive <strong>standard library.</strong></li>
                    <li>Currently one of the fastest growing software development languages</li>
                </ul>
            </aside>

            <aside>
                <h2>What's Python Used For?</h2>

                <p>To reiterate, Python is a general-purpose coding language. This means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Python can be used for other types of programming and software 
                    development besides just web development. Some examples include back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts.</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li><strong>Data Science:</strong> Data science is possibly the most popular application for Python. This is because the Python libraries are so powerful
                        and were developed for data analysis and visualization.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Learning:</strong> The machine learning programs in Python are not like the programs that we typically write in a Python script. In Machine Learning, 
                        the system is trained to "think" and make decisions based on previous knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Back-End Web Development:</strong> Python can be used to handle the server-side of web applications.  Python can interact with all the necessary
                        databases as the user requests data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Medicine and Pharmacology:</strong> Python has many amazing applications in the medical field. There is plenty of technology being combined
                        with medical knowledge to provide more accuracy and efficiency when diagnosing patients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Biology and Bioinformatics:</strong> Python has amazing applications concerning Biology and Bioinformatics, as well. From the processing of
                        DNA sequences to modeling biochemical structures, Python has some amazing capabilities to assist these procedures.</li>
                </ul>
